# dbinstall

batch file that creates a virtual environment and pip installs all databaker related packages for cmd.

# setup

Install annaconda (for python 3.5+) on your windows machine.

Install git for Windows - you must be using the git-cmd command prompt.

# usage

download or clone to get the included install.cmd and run it from the command line. 

This will create a python3 environment called "databaker" with everything you should need installed.

to activate that environment open up your (not anaconda!) command prompt and enter `activate databaker`. To deactivate it open a command prompt and enter `deactivate`

`databaker` in this context is just the name of the python virtual environment that has databaker + associated libraries installed.
